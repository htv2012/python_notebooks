    "1. Every if-statement must have an else.\n",
    "1. If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.\n",

    "    I disagree with these. Consider the following function:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def compare_models(model_a, model_b, ignore_attributes=None):\n",
    "            if ignore_attributes is None:\n",
    "                ignore_attributes = []\n",
    "            # The rest of the code here\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.\n",
    "1. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.\n",
    "1. Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I agree with these. I often see if statements that are several nesting levels deep, in which case, we should package them in separate functions. As for the last point, consider the following code segnment:"
